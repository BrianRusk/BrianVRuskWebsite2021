I completed my PhD in the Language Acquisition Lab of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Alberta and I am a former SSHRC Doctoral Fellow. My main research area is child second language (L2) acquisition, and I'm interested both in acquisition of an L2 as a community majority language as well as acquisition of a minority-L2 in classroom language immersion settings. My overarching research goal is to provide a better foundational understanding of L2 acquisition as an emergent phenomenon by studying children and adults who speak Mandarin as a first language as they acquire English as an L2.
