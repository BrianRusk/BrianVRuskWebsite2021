I am currently a lecturer in the Department of English at Da-Yeh University in Taiwan. I am a former SSHRC Doctoral Fellow who completed his PhD in the Language Acquisition Lab of the Department of Linguistics at the University of Alberta. My main research area is child second language (L2) acquisition, and I'm interested in both context where children acquire the L2 as a community majority language, as well as, acquisition of a minority-L2 in classroom language immersion settings.
